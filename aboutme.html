    <h1>About Anthony</h1>
    <p>I am from Warwick, Rhode Island and I attended Toll Gate High School. <br>

        I am a Computer Science major because I have always taken an interest <br>
        in coding and advanced mathematics.  I plan to obtain my BS within the next <br>
        4 years at URI. <br><br>

        My favorite foods are:

    <ol>
        <li>Chicken Parmesan</li>
        <li>Sandwiches</li>
        <li>Cereal</li>
    </ol>

    In my free time I enjoy watching and playing soccer.  My favorite soccer team <br>
    is Chelsea FC.  They are located in London, England and play in the top division <br>
    of English professional soccer, the Premeier League.
